Dear NeoTech Employees,

We have received your complaint and we have taken some action.
We totally understand your situation, we apologize for the inconvenience caused.
On behalf of the entire staff at BTS, we would like to offer you a refund of your hotel bill.
We can't do anything about flights problems, it's out of our control.
But the client comfort is our responsability and we have to provide acceptable alternative solutions.
Following this recent problem we decided to stop our collaboration with this hotel,
in order to always keeps up standards to our services.

We hope that you will continue to use our services despite that problem.
We will be happy to work with you again in the future.

Kind regards,
BTS Compagny.
